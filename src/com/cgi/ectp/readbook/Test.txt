This is a sample text file. The idea behind this text file is simple; run a test of reading in English text into my program. If I can read in this simple text effectively, reading in larger text should be an identical process. This SHOULD make it relatively easy! Who knows if it actually will though? I should probably say can't, wouldn't, and shouldn't to account for contractions. Also, fast-paced to account for dashes.
